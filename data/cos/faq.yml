- - Am I eligible to apply for the program?
  - As this is a Master’s degree,students are expected to have already completed a Bachelor’s degree. Good knowledge of English, and familiarity with computers are also necessary. In terms of an educational background, exposure to either a STEM field or Cognitive Psychology (e.g., through prior studies) is required for admission. Courses will include induction elements to complement the students' educational background.
- - What are the employment opportunities for graduates of this program?
  - With a Master’s in Cognitive Systems, graduates have employment opportunities in the two traditional areas of Cognitive Psychology and Computer Science, but also in the new emerging area of Cognitive Systems. Generally speaking, graduates of the program will be qualified to contribute to basic and applied research aiming at the optimization of human-computer interaction and/or the application of computational tools in the understanding of cognition (research, research and development, and research and innovation at public and private centers/companies). In particular, students will be able to work in organizations in the areas of intelligent systems, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cognitive system development, with large companies such as IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple actively seeking, and offering lucrative salaries for, employees in the emerging areas that are covered by the program of study. Their ability to design and develop systems also offers the opportunity to graduates to work as developers in large software companies, with the ability to incorporate in the traditional software development cycle novel and cutting-edge techniques that are inspired by human cognition. The graduates’ knowledge of cognitive psychology theories and methodologies will further allow them the choice of working in treatment and health facilities, helping people with cognitive disabilities, while exploiting their expertise in the development of cognitive systems to develop novel solutions for patients. Irrespectively of the focus of their studies, graduates will be well-versed in an exciting new area of research that can lead them to pursue a Ph.D. program at Open University of Cyprus, University of Cyprus, or at other competitive Ph.D. programs across the world.
- - Do I have to study full-time and/or complete the entire program?
  - You may elect to enroll on a part-time basis (i.e., less than 30 ECTS / 3 courses per semester). Also, you may register for selected courses without completing the entire program, if you wish to obtain only a certificate of completion and not an M.Sc. degree.
- - When do I have to pay the tuition fees?
  - Tuition fees are paid for each registered course (not for the entire program), before the beginning of the semester / year on which the courses are taken. Details about the procedure will be made available to enrolled students in due time.
- - Am I eligible to apply for a scholarship?
  - Applications for scholarships are due after the completion of the first semester of (full-time) studies. More information on eligibility criteria (generally based on need and merit) will be made available to enrolled students in due time.
- - Do I have to be a Cypriot citizen and/or visit Cyprus during my studies?
  - The program is intended for an international audience. Courses are taught in English and all coursework takes place online. A final exam for each course is taken in-class at the student’s country of residence or in designated exam centers in Cyprus and abroad (subject to factors and conditions determined by the University). An optional summer camp in Cyprus is available for those students who wish to take advantage of this opportunity.
- - My organization works on Cognitive Systems. How can I contribute?
  - We are open to discussion with interested organizations or individuals who would like to contribute in some manner. Please contact us for more information.

- - Method of Instruction
  - Courses are taught in English using a blended distance learning methodology. Students have live online weekly meetings with their course instructors, which are recorded and available for offline viewing as well. Course forums are used to interact with the instructors asynchronously, and all relevant educational activities, course assignments and submissions, etc., are done online via the course’s educational platform. Coursework includes biweekly assignments and class projects.
- - Final exams
  - Final exams are taken in-class at the student’s country of residence or in designated exam centers in Cyprus and abroad (subject to factors and conditions determined by the University). Students also have the option of attending a summer camp in Cyprus.
